# Personal Data Management Tools

Bookmarklets to help you manage your personal data on social media.

## Usage 

Get the bookmarklets here: [url forthcoming]

Drag the links to your bookmarks toolbar to "install," then navigate to the relevant page and click the bookmarklet to use it.

You must be logged in to your account. The bookmarklets do not collect any data, only help to click buttons in your browser. They will delete your data in the same way that you would with manual clicking. The data will not be backed up or recoverable via the bookmarklet. 

## Available bookmarklets

### Twitter

* Delete all your tweets older than a certain number of hours

### LinkedIn

* Delete all your LinkedIn posts
* Delete all your LinkedIn messages (your copy only)
* Delete all your LinkedIn connections

## In-progress bookmarklets

### Twitter

* Unlike all your liked posts
* Delete all your DMs (your copy only)

## Contributions

Contributions of new bookmarklets for any social media site are welcome, as are fixes for existing bookmarklets.

Please include in your PR the URL of the page your script is designed to work on.

## Issues

Bookmarklets are usually dependent on the position and naming of DOM elements, so an update to a social media's website may break them. It will then be necessary to update the bookmarklet script with the new DOM elements.

If you are logged in to your account and on the correct page and the bookmarklet does not work, please submit an issue.
